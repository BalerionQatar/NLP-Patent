# NLP Engine for Google Patents

## Introduction

This project involves a Google Patent PDF processor. The repository consists of all the code required to run the web application. You can use the pdf files available in the dataset to upload the pdf files, and you'd be able to see the parsed results. The NLP engine recognizes the variables and values, and it is also capable of recognizing variances between two patent pdf files, when it comes to their variables and the values.
